### What I learned

I learned many things in this first project of mine. To be honest, I've been studying HTML and CSS for months already and I was so confident that I would finish the project in a few hours but I was stuck in some parts where I couldn't find out what to do. I was really struggline in making the website responsive and how to make the image move smoothly as I adjust the size of the webpage.

I learned about making the image appear as a background. Like this: 
.image {
	opacity: 0.5;
	background-position: center;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-size: cover;
}
Also, the flex-flow: row wrap: 
.container {
		flex-flow: row wrap;
	}
 
If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
